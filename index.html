  <h2>🧭 Future Direction & Sustainability</h2>

  <p>
    Amanah Media is currently a non-commercial demo initiative.
    However, for long-term sustainability, the platform may
    explore Sharīʿah-compliant methods of support in the future,
    strictly under scholarly guidance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Halal and ethically screened advertisements only</li>
    <li>No promotion of haram products or services</li>
    <li>Preference for educational, Islamic, and community-benefiting ads</li>

    <li>Transparency and accountability in monetization</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Any form of monetization will be implemented only after
    careful review to ensure it does not compromise Islamic
    values, user trust, or the purpose of the platform.
  </p>

  <p>
